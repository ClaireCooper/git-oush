# git oush

So everyone knows when you type `git oush` instead of `git push`.

## Requirements

- bash
- aplay (`apt install alsa-utils` on many distros)
- git

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the root of the repo
- Run `./install.sh <installation location>` e.g. `./install.sh /usr/local`

**Note**: You may need to run `install.sh` with `sudo` if you do not have permission to write to the installation location. The `<installation location>/bin` must be in the PATH variable.

## Usage

- Turn your volume up
- Run `git oush`
